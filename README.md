# React Heardle Clone

## About

This a small project with the aim to build my own version of the game [Heardle](https://www.spotify.com/heardle/?) in React. I play the game regularly and after first beginning to learn React, I was inspired to give it a try myself! The app accesses the Spotify API for track data - in particular a search feature that shows a list of possible songs based on the users input.

The project is a work in progress! My skills have developed a lot since I first began this project so I hope to do some light refactoring with my new knowledge before hosting the app. I'm currently using a royalty-free placeholder for the song to guess and hope to replace this so the game is actually playable.

### Future Goals

- I'm currently using a hardcoded mp3 as the song to guess, but I would love to access a track via an API. I have looked into the Spotify Web SDK and the Soundcloud API and will explore these at a later date.
- To add to this, it would be great to make a better clone by randomising the song each day.
- I would like to try making a themed game i.e. only female artists or a certain genre. It would be interesting to implement this when the songs are randomised!
